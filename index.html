								<h2>Hello, and welcome!</h2>

							<p>
								I am Shai Bhardwaj, a student at Carnegie Mellon University studying mathematics with a concentration in discrete math and logic. When I'm not knee deep in proofs, I love to experiment with visual and more lately, user interface designs to produce a product that is not only beautiful and seamless in functionality, but also in interaction. I love to collaborate with people because we all have something we can learn from one another. I've seen synergy is displayed at its' best during coding and design projects alike, and I truly believe that working with others makes way for the innovations that are shaping our time. I hope that my background in math lets me explore avenues of ui/ux in the most efficient, yet effective way.

							Apart from that, I enjoy watercolor painting and doing calligrpahy in my free time! I have been practicing calligraphy for a little over two years now, and it is as therapeutic as it is beautiful. I have an instagram dedicated to it, make sure to check me out @sb.calligraphy.
							I'm very open minded so I also love to try new foods, experiences, and cultures. One of my favorite discoveries is Laos cuisine, a palette that I hadn't been exposed to before coming to Pittsburgh. I hope to always be creating and experiencing new things, taking myself out of my comfort zone and producing the extraordinary.
							Thanks for visiting my website!
